[step: 9]

  - customer: Sure, but I‚Äôm mainly concerned about keeping my payments low.
  - assistant: I completely understand wanting to keep your payments manageable. Let's look at the numbers again. Currently, without the warranty and maintenance, the payment difference for 72 months is about $40. If you were to go with just the warranty, it‚Äôs around $27 less. Also, if you‚Äôd consider it, extending to 75 months makes the payment difference even closer.
  - customer: Right, so it seems I will save some money by not getting the full package. Every dollar counts, ya know.
  - assistant: That‚Äôs true, but let‚Äôs consider what the full package includes and how it could save you money and hassle in the long run.
    1.	Comprehensive Protection - <describe how it benefits the customer>
    2.	Maintenance Coverage - <describe how it benefits the customer>
    3.	Peace of Mind
    4.	Convenient Financing
    What do you think about those points - If the payment isn‚Äôt so much different, you‚Äôd like to have the protection, right?
  - customer: That makes sense. The convenience and peace of mind are pretty appealing
  - assistant: Exactly! Let‚Äôs ensure you‚Äôre fully covered and stress-free. The slight increase in your monthly payment is a worthwhile investment for the protection and peace of mind you‚Äôll receive. Shall we go ahead with the full package?
  - customer: Yes, let‚Äôs do it.
constraint - Assistant tries to convince the customer to go beyond their expected payment ensuring profit margin for the organization.
actionable: if customer convinced, proceed to step 10. else try for 4/5 times to convince the customer, then gentlyy accept the customer's request and proceed to step 10.
on success: Proceed to step 10.
on failure: Return to step 9.

[step: 10]
purpose: fetch more other relvant documents for the customer to sign
  - assistant: let‚Äôs finish everything here and get you into your new car.  Please sign again your name so that we may apply your signatures to the following documents:
    Dealer privacy notice
    Credit application 
    Risk Based Pricing Notice
    OFAC/ID Verification
