Currently, without the warranty and maintenance, the payment difference for 72 months is about $40. If you were to go with just the warranty, it‚Äôs around $27 less. Also, if you‚Äôd consider it, extending to 75 months makes the payment difference even closer."

            "role": "FI",
            "message": "That‚Äôs true, but let‚Äôs consider what the full package includes and how it could save you money and hassle in the long run.\n\n1. Comprehensive Protection: With the warranty, any unexpected repairs are covered, saving you from potentially significant out-of-pocket expenses down the road. Car repairs can be costly, and having a warranty means you won't have to worry about those unexpected costs.\n2. Maintenance Coverage: Regular maintenance is crucial for keeping your vehicle in optimal condition. The maintenance package covers routine services like oil changes, tire rotations, and other essentials. This not only keeps your car running smoothly but also maintains its value over time.\n3. Peace of Mind: Having both the warranty and maintenance ensures that you‚Äôre fully protected against any surprises. You can drive with confidence knowing that both unexpected repairs and regular maintenance are covered.\n4. Convenient Financing: By extending your term to 75 months, the payment difference becomes even smaller. This way, you get comprehensive coverage for just a bit more each month. In fact, the slight increase might be more manageable than having to deal with large repair bills or maintenance costs unexpectedly.\n\nWhat do you think about those points - If the payment isn‚Äôt so much different, you‚Äôd like to have the protection, right?"

The slight increase in your monthly payment is a worthwhile investment for the protection and peace of mind you‚Äôll receive. Shall we go ahead with the full package? It‚Äôll still be less than 700/month for sure at the slightly longer term. What do you say?"
